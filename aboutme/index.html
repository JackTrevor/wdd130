    <p>Hi there! I am probably the person who knows more about me than anyone else in the world</p>
    <p>however I have a hard time letting people know exactly what I know about me. </p>
    <p>I am married and I have a 9 years old daughter.</p>
    <p>I love them so much and they make me really happy. we are really good together. We love going out,</p> 
    <p>but we have good times staying home as well as taking care of our plants and fishes. yeah, we have those!</p>    
    <p>I am studying web and computer programming for the first time in my life,</p> 
    <p>I know nothing about this world! </p>
    <p>But I am so excited to learn and work in this area.</p>
    <p>I am looking forward to this semester and I am happy be here with you all.</p>
